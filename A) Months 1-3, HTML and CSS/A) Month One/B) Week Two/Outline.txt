Week Two Challenge:

Let's build upon your biography page from (Week One), incorporate your favorite colors and make it yours.  

Challenge Guideline:

Style your name/nickname to look special, it is yours after all!
Style your image, would it look better in a circle, should it have a border?
Style your hobbies, try to make them nice to look at, make one stand out above the rest, make them look as special as you feel about them!
Style your introduction text to represent you, should it be in it's own box, have a larger font because it's your story, maybe the first letter should stand out like a news article?

Try to build upon your website with as little external help as possible, but don't be afraid to use resources to help you get it done.
