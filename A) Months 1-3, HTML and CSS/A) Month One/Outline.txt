The first month, it's a scary month, but you're going to do so many amazing things!

I hope you're excited to begin your journey into Web Development.  

This first month your main focus is going to be on HTML.  

You're going to see amazing things happen, you're going to press keys on your keyboard 
and be able to open the HTML page in a web browser and see what you've typed come to life!

Stick with it, you'll be fine!
