Week One Challenge:

Build a simple biography website, don't worry about making it beautiful with CSS, that will come later.  

Challenge Guideline:

Include your name or nickname.
Include an image.
Include some fun facts about yourself; hobbies, abilities, countries you've visited, anything!
Include a short story about why you want to be a web developer, what got you interested in web development?

Try to build this website with as little external help as possible, but don't be afraid to use resources to help you get it done.
