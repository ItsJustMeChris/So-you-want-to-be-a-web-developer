# So, you want to be a web developer?

This twelve month plan is designed to give those who wish to enter the ever growing field of Web Development a fighting chance, without the need to pursue typical education.  This is simply an outline for self teaching, and will work best with other forms of teaching, but it is possible to follow it without going through a college degree, results may vary from person to person.

## The outline.

| Month(s) | Subject(s)  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1-3 | HTML & CSS |
| 4-5 | JavaScript |
| 6-8 | Front End Frameworks |
| 9-11 | Back End Language/Framework |
| 12 | Final Project |

## The Breakdown.

### Months 1-3, HTML & CSS.

During these months, your primary focus will be learning HTML and CSS, building simple, static web pages, where the main goal is learning how to organize and structure data. Your goal should by the end of the first three months should be:
- The developer is able to build simple static web pages confidently.
- The developer is comfortable enough to use resources to find information on features of HTML and CSS, and implement them into a website without the need to build websites around the concept.
- The developer is knowledgeable enough to build static websites which are responsive and mostly user friendly.

### Months 4-5, JavaScript.

I have chosen to allocate one to two months to JavaScript, because it is a powerful, robust language which could have it's own year dedicated to it. The time can be split from two months to one month, if you feel that you will need extra time learning something else. That being said, JavaScript is the main thing you will be using in Front End Frameworks as well, my recommendation is to use the full two months and then also plan on using NodeJS for a back end language.

During these two months, the developer will learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM based on user interaction, take user input and utilize it, as well as learn some in depth concepts of programming with JavaScript. By the end of these months, the developer can expect to:
- Be able to utilize user input to perform actions.
- Manipulate the dom based on user interaction.
- Write clean and elegant JavaScript.

### Months 6-8, Front End Frameworks.

During these months, you will learn about Front End Frameworks and how to use them to build fast, interactive, single page applications.

By the end of these months, the developer should anticipate being able to:
- Build single page applications.
- Use user input to modify the DOM.

### Months 9-11, Back End Language/Framework

During these months, you will learn how to build back end web applications, which take user input and store information in a database, you will also explore building RESTful web APIs, which you will then use your knowledge of front end frameworks to build fast, dynamic, single page web applications with persistent information storage across devices.

### Month 12, The Big Project

Well, you made it this far, you should pat yourself on the back, because this month is all about you! You will use the final month to produce your first large scale web application using the latest web technologies. Your goal should be to build something that you are proud to call yours, this will be the highlight of your resume! By the end of this final month, the developer should expect to be a prime candidate for hire, I wish you luck!

### Final Thoughts

I want to create a small list of projects that will help people get introduced to web development, I've started coming up with some 'simple' projects, and currently am trying to come up with ways to keep them quick and easy, but still educational.  These are simply recommendations from my point of view to try and help others that may want project ideas.  My goal is to start off each Month with a generalized project, and build upon it throughout the weeks of the month, this will keep you in a familiar environment while learning, and also assist you in coming up with projects.  I, at the time of writing this, am very busy with school and other personal things, so I highly encourage others to try and come up with projects to add or ways to improve the existing ones!  I appreciate any help, and hope that this is able to help others.  Thank you, enjoy your learning!
